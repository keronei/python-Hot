# python-Hot
This project does a simple arithmetic operation and returns the first parameter as a username. There are two scripts:

1. python
2. shell.

They both perfom exactly the same function.

###Prerequisites
You will need python installed in your system in order to execute the python file.
For shell counterpart, being on any version of Linux, you are good to go.

###Running
In order to test this files, this is the procedure:


This adds two digits
```
$total = $first_num + $second_num
```
For shell

```
~$ ./shell_.sh YourName
```
For python

```
~$ python python_.py YourName
```
python version may not matter much at the moment. ðŸ˜Ž
